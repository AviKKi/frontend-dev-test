# Frontend Development Test

Hi !

First of all. we want to take the time to thank you for doing our small in house react test and maybe work in our team eventually :)! One of the goal of this test is to have an overview of your technical and creative skills.

This test is a Tic Tac Toe game. Youâ€™ll have to integrate the different application screens and follow the requirements to implement the logic. 

You will find in this repository everything you need to complete the game; Assets, psd files, boilerplate react code.
